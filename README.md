# beanz_assessment

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

 -Before running the project, make sure you have installed Node.js (due to using json-server for the mock API)
 -Clone the Repository from the Github link(
    git clone  https://github.com/JumanaHani/Beanz-Assignment.git
    cd your-repo)
 -Navigate to the project folder and start the server (json-server --watch db.json --port 3000)
 -Copy the end point link(http://localhost:3000/Books) in BookApiService in Url variable , and if you test in physical device change the ip address to your server device ip address
 -Run the app (Flutter run)
